# Programming with Python Tkinter
I recently learned Python Tkinter for making GUI applications and here are some of the application I made with it:
1. dice.py (*a one-roll dice app that shows the 2D result of the dice*)
2. grocery.py (*a simulation of a grocery app where you make your with item filtering capabilities shopping digitally and can print the receipt afterwards*)
3. tictactoe.py (*a functional multi-player game of tic-tac-toe*)
4. DeliveryReceipt.py (*this program is like a cashier - receipt kind of program where you select items and put the selected items into an excel sheet which could then be printed*)
