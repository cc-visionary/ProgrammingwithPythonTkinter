# ProgrammingwithPythonTkinter
Here, I will post the stuffs that I will make in tkinter. I am sure it would not be good, but I like to track my progress and I want to share my progress. I am still 16 years old, programming for about a year now but is still a beginner. But am currently doing my best to learn a lot of stuff that could probably be useful for me in the future.
